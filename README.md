# Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, sentiment analysis is performed on three subsets of tweet-eval :offensive, stance-abortion, emotions. 
All the required explanation is already in jupiter notebook. The data is from huggingface website. There are plenty of datasets available, this one is one of the popular one and since it has
many subsets it was easier to show different exploration on it.



### Initial Configuration

You just need to install datasets and huggingface_hub first.
